One day I was fed up with VK's link redirection system. So I decided to make this simple program to replace 'vk.com/away' with an actual working link.
Just type in your link from VK messages, press "Transform" and get the original link. Press "Clear Screen" to type in a new one.
Maybe someday I'll make a site out of this idea...
